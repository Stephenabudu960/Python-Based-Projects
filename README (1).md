# 🎓 Kiddies School Data Analysis  
*A Portfolio Project by Stephen Abudu*

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves the creation and analysis of a **synthetic dataset** representing a kiddies-level school. The dataset includes 500 students across 10 attributes, simulating real-world education data at the nursery and primary level.

Using Python and key data analysis libraries, this project demonstrates data generation, exploration, and insightful analysis — answering questions that could help educators improve academic performance and attendance.

## 📂 Dataset Features

| Column Name       | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `student_id`      | Unique ID for each student (e.g., STU0001) |
| `name`            | Student's full name |
| `gender`          | Gender (Male/Female) |
| `age`             | Age range from 3 to 10 |
| `grade_level`     | Educational level (Nursery 1 – Primary 4) |
| `math_score`      | Math score out of 100 |
| `english_score`   | English score out of 100 |
| `science_score`   | Science score out of 100 |
| `attendance_rate` | Attendance rate as a percentage |
| `teacher_remark`  | Qualitative assessment (e.g., Excellent, Needs Improvement) |

## 🔍 Key Questions Answered

1. Which grade level has the highest average math score?
2. What is the average score per subject across all students?
3. Are boys or girls performing better in English?
4. How many students scored above 90 in all three subjects?
5. Which students received an "Excellent" remark but had low attendance?
6. What’s the average age per grade level?
7. Which grade level struggles the most in science?
8. **Is there a relationship between attendance and academic performance?**
9. What’s the distribution of teacher remarks?
10. How many 10-year-olds are in Nursery/KG (possible placement issue)?

## 🧪 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3.10
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Faker (for synthetic data)
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)

## 📊 Insights & Outcomes

- **Nursery 2** had the highest attendance rate overall.
- **Primary 3** students had the strongest science performance.
- A moderate **positive correlation** was found between attendance rate and academic scores.
- Several students scored exceptionally well but had **low attendance**, raising concern for individual tracking.
- Most students received **Good or Excellent** remarks, but there’s a notable portion needing improvement.

## 📁 How to Use

1. Clone or download the notebook.
2. Run the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
3. Install any required libraries with:
   ```bash
   pip install faker pandas matplotlib
   ```
